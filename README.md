# card-shuffler-memory-booster
An app that shuffles 52 cards or less and you need to memorize them and place them in the exact order they were randomly generated for you.


### Context

Read [Tim Ferriss's excellent post](http://fourhourworkweek.com/2013/02/07/how-to-memorize-a-shuffled-deck-of-cards-in-less-than-60-seconds/) about how to remember a shuffled deck of cards. It's possible and really cool!
And after you've read it, check out a [table of personalities](img/card-matrix-ed-cooke-11x17.pdf) that Ed Cooke (grandmaster of memory ; haven't you read the post yet?!) has created.
